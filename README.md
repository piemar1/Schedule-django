# Schedule-django


Description
-----------

The web application allows stacking of work schedule of the team. There is an option to set a team and a schedule for a given month and year. There is also option to fill the schedule randomly according to given parameters, and export the schedule to a pdf file. Written in python 3.4.

Ready to use, but still has to be optimalized and completed with JS and other front-end features. In the future I plan to add possibility to the use by many users ( by adding the possibility for creating an accounts).

Requirements
------------

Django 1.9.7
psycopg2 2.4.5
reportlab 3.3.0
